We will follow the official Python version; PEP 8, which indicates:

  - Maximum line length of 79 characters
  - Code in the core Python distribution should always use UTF-8
  - Imports should be one per line and placed at the beginning of each class
  - Comments should be single-sentence for easy readability and understanding
  - Inline comments should be indented with a single tab space

  - Classes should be named using the UpperCamelCase convention, where each word starts with a capital letter and there are no spaces between words.

  - Methods should be named following the snake_case convention, in which all words are written in lowercase and separated from each other by underscores (_).
